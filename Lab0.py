# Question 1
#   Last summer I mostly just worked and spent time with my family and friends.
#   Next summer, I'm taking a trip to Hawaii in June.


# Question 2
#   From this lab, I want to learn how to properly code in python.
#   I've heard that it's very useful to have an understanding of python for
#   interviews and the workplace in general. So it would be very useful to
#   gain a good understanding of python
